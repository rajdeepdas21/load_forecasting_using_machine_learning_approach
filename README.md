Electric load forecasting is crucial to power system planning and operation, effective management of resources, and maintaining grid stability. Optimized generation scheduling, balancing the load, and maintenance of infrastructure rely on accurate forecasts, leading to minimized operational costs and improved quality of service. The project aimed at creating a short-term load forecasting model with artificial neural networks (ANNs) to enhance the accuracy of forecasting and assist in optimal energy distribution.

The data employed includes 8,867 data points covering historical load demand fluctuations. Due to the temporal variations and periodic load patterns, a lag feature of 24 hours was added to take advantage of past day data for meaningful forecasting. The ANN model was implemented with 20 hidden layers, considering complexity, learning ability, and computational cost. The use of an optimal model structure allows the network to learn meaningfully without consuming high computation.

Some machine learning algorithms were tested for their performance in accuracy forecasting. These were Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Linear SVM, RBF SVM, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), AdaBoost, Bagging (Tree), and MLP (Neural Net). Through comparing this variety of models, we sought to identify the highest-performing algorithm for short-term load forecasting.

Model performance was determined through salient statistical measures of Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and the Coefficient of Determination (RÂ²). These measures gave a detailed picture of the predictive accuracy and reliability of the model. Cross-validation also confirmed its strength, showing how it could generalize well across various subsets of data, curtailing the danger of overfitting and maintaining steady performance under real-world conditions.

The results emphasize the significance of employing suitable neural network models and learning algorithms for reliable short-term load forecasting. Optimized forecasting modeling can greatly enhance energy providers' decision-making through efficiently allocating resources, ensuring stability of the power grid, and reducing operational expenditure. In addition, sophisticated forecasting methods enable integration of renewable resources with greater reliability, leading towards an eco-friendlier power network.

Future research may include other external variables like weather, economic measures, and social events to make forecasting more precise. Hybrid models that blend neural networks with other machine learning methods, including decision trees, ensemble models, or support vector machines, might also improve forecasting. Deep learning architectures and real-time data streams may also offer even more accuracy and responsiveness. Development in this direction will lead to more robust and smart power systems.
